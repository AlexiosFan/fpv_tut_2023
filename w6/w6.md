# Week6
In this week we take a closer look at the inductive/recursive data types

## Lists
```ocaml
type 'a t = 'a list = 
|[]
|(::) of 'a * 'a list
```
We need to implement a next few functions. First we determine if they should be recursive. 

1. hd: return the first element of the list
```ocaml
hd [1;2;3] = 1
```
2. tl: return the rest of the list following the first element
```ocaml
tl [1;2;3] = [2;3]
```
3. length: return the length of the list
```ocaml
length [1;2;3] = 3
```
4. append: concatenate two lists
```ocaml
append [1;2;3] [4;5;6] = [1;2;3;4;5;6]
```
5. rev: reverse the list
```ocaml
rev [1;2;3] = [3;2;1]
```
6. nth: return the n-th element of the list, indexing from 0
```ocaml
nth [1;2;3] 0 = 1 
```

**Note:** If a function is recursive, we shouldn't forget the **rec** keyword.

## Binary Search trees
 ### How do you define a binary tree?
```ocaml
type bst = Leaf | Node of bst * bst
```

### What should we add for a search tree?
```ocaml
type bst = Leaf | Node of int * bst * bst
```

### What is an Option?
A container type useful for searching. **Some x** is returned
if a particular **x** is found, otherwise we return **None**.
There are also other usages.

### Similarly, implement the following functions
1. *inspect* accesses value in a node, we need to use the option type here.
2. *to_list* converts a binary search tree into an **inorder** list.
3. *insert* inserts a new element into the tree. Be aware of the sortedness structure!
4. *remove* removes the element in the tree, similar property to the *insert*
