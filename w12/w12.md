# Rules
We first familiarize ourselves with the rules in equational reasoning

1. The definition of a function, the rule is just the name of the function
```ocaml
let f l = match l with [] -> 0 | _ -> 1 

            f [1;2;3] 
(rule f) =  match [1;2;3] with [] -> 0 | _ -> 1
```
2. Function application, the rule is call **fun**
```ocaml
            (fun x -> x + 1) 1 
(rule fun)  = 1 + 1
```
3. Induction hypothesis, the rule is called **I.H.**
4. Arithmetic Operations, **arith**
5. Pattern Matching **match**
6. Local binding, or just let, **let**
7. If you have showed a lemma, the name of the lemma is also a rule.
