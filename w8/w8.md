# Week 8
In this week we talk about the advanced concepts of functional prorgamming,
i.e. tail recursion, lazy evaluation and partial application. 

# Tail recursion 
A tail call is a function call as the last operation inside a function. 
A function is tail recursive if and only if all of the recursive calls 
are tail calls. Recall the square sum function from the last week
```ocaml
  let squaresum = function 
    | [] -> 0 
    | x :: xs -> x*x + squaresum xs
```
Which function is the tail call? Is this function tail-recursive?

## Exercise a
Name the tail call function and decide if the functions are tail recursive. 
```ocaml
let rec f a = match a with
  | [] -> a 
  | x::xs -> (x + 1)::f xs
```
>!cons, non-tail-recursvie!<
```ocaml 
let rec g a b =
  if a = b then 0 
  else if a < b then g (a + 1) b 
  else g (a - 1) b
```
>!tail-recursive!<
```ocaml 
let rec h a b c =
  if b then h a (not b) (c * 2) 
  else if c > 1000 then a 
  else h (a + 2) (not b) c * 2
```
>!Not tail-recursive in the last case, the tail call is multiplication!<
```ocaml 
let rec i a = function
  | [] -> a 
  | x::xs -> i (i (x,x) [x]) xs
```
>!not tail call for the nested i!<

## Conversion to tail recursion
We consider the case where only one recursive call is needed. 
If a function *f* is implemented without tail recursion, 
there is an operator *op* combining the result of the tail call $f(xs)$ 
and another intermediate constant $c$. For example, 
```ocaml 
let f = function
  |[] -> 0 
  |x::xs -> x + f xs
```
To enable the tail recursion, we can use an additional argument `acc`, standing for the accumulator, to apply the operator and save the intermediate constant. 
```ocaml
let f' acc = function 
  | [] -> acc 
  | x :: xs -> f' (acc + x) xs 
```
For functions in which more recursive calls are needed, we don't consider them 
a lot, for those who are interested, you can find an introduction here, 
[haskell passing style](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Continuation_passing_style)

# Lazy evaluation 
We want to take a closer look at the infinite data structures using the lazy evaluation. Let's take a look at the lazy list. 
```ocaml
type 'a llist = Cons of 'a * (unit -> 'a llist)
```
How is this list infinite? How do we access i-th list elements?

# Partial Application 
Let's consider an abstract function 
$$
f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2
$$.
How do you computer $4 + x^2$ given an abitrary x?
$$
g(x) = f(2, x)
$$
$$
h(x) = f(x, 2)
$$.
This is called partial application, for you only apply the function partially 
with only a few arguments. 
```ocaml 
let a = (fun a b -> (+) b)

let b = (fun a b -> List.fold_left b 1 (List.map ( * ) a))

let c = (fun a b c -> c (a + b)) 3

let d = (fun a b c -> b (c a) :: [a]) "x"

let e = (let x = List.map in x (<))
```
Which function is applied partially, and what is the type of the resulting function?
```ocaml 
  a : int -> int -> int 
  b : int list -> (int -> (int -> int) -> int) -> int 
  c : int -> (int -> 'a) -> 'a 
  d : ('a -> string) -> (string -> 'a) -> string list 
  e: 'a list -> ('a -> bool) list 
```
