# fpv_tut_2023
Repository for functional programming and verification course 2023. The weekly used notes will be uploaded.

## A brief introduction to the predicate logic is also available!
Feel free to use it or report errors if you find any!

## How to use this repo?
This repo is made up of 2 parts.
- The old slides from the previous year, only for the programming weeks. These materials will not be updated, given that there are some typo there. They are of free usage.
- The new materials from the current year, which are all markdown files. To use them you should open the file in vscode editor and have the following extensions for markdown installed:
  1. Markdown
  2. Reddit Spoilers for Markdown Preview

These should be available in the marketplace of vscode.

It is also possible to view the notes in the github page, where the spoiler function is not supported, which results in the notes to be less readable.
