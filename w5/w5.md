# Week 5
We start with the **Ocaml** this week. Only purely functional features of **Ocaml** are allowed.

## Revision of data types in Ocaml
| Type | Instances | Operators |
| - | - | - |
| int | 1, 0, -3, etc. | **+ - \* \ mod** |
| float | 1.0, -5.5 etc. | **+. -. \*. \.** |
| bool | true false | **not || &&** |
| string | "Hello World" etc. | **^**|
| char | 'A', '1', etc.  | - |
**Note: For overflow or division by zero, there will be infinity, neg_infinity or nan returned**
Then answer a few questions
  - Is there a type coercion in **Ocaml**? <br>
  What will happen to this program?
  ```ocaml
    let a = 1 + 0.5;;
  ```
  >!Compiling fails. Integers are not automatically coverted into floats.!<
  - Under which condition are infinity, neg_infinity or nan returned raised?
  
## Tuples and lists
1. Tuples are defined as **(x1, x2, ..., xn)**, accessing is possible via pattern matching
```ocaml
  let f a = match a with
   | (a, b, c) -> other codes
```
2. Lists are defined as an inductive type
```ocaml
type 'a t = 'a list = 
|[]
|(::) of 'a * 'a list
```
So a list $l$ is either an empty list or a list with at least one element
```ocaml
  l = []  or l = (x :: xs)
```
Hence, if we want to access the list, we also have to use the pattern matching.
```ocaml
let rec length l = match l with 
  | [] -> 0 
  | (x :: xs) -> 1 + length xs
```
*Note: the **rec** keyword is necessary for defining a recursive function.* <br>
For now on, we never use a loop, but will iterate any iterable object
via recursion.

## Functions
1. Definitions
```ocaml
  let f x = ... ;;
  (*global definition*)
  fun a b c -> ... 
  (*local definition, actually a lambda function as in imperative languagese*)
```
2. Variable binding
Sometimes, we want to reuse a value. However, due to the functional features, it is not easy to do it. 
```ocaml

let add a b = a + b;;
let mul a b = a * b;;

(*if we want to calculate (x * x) + (x * x)*)
let f1 x = add (mul x x) (mul x x);;

(*if we want to reuse the codes*)
let f2 x = 
(let 
   y = mul x x 
  in 
   add y y) ;;
```
So the variable binding realizes a imperative feature in functional 
languages, and it is not forbidden in homeworks or exams.

## Records: a basic user-defined type
```ocaml
type person = {given:string; sur:string; age:int};;
let paul = { given="Paul"; sur="Meier"; age=24 };;
(*How we defined and initialize a record object*)

let pauls_age = paul.age;; 
(*How we access it*)
```
